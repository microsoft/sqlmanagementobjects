# SQL Management Objects

SQL Management Objects, or SMO, provides objects and APIs to discover, modify, and script out SQL Server entities.

## Documentation

See https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/overview-smo

## Usage

SMO packages on nuget.org include:

### Microsoft.SqlServer.SqlManagementObjects

This package is the primary development SDK for SMO. It provides both NetFx and .Net binaries. Capabilities of the NetStandard binaries may be limited by that platform, such as the lack of WMI support.

The binaries are strong named and Authenticode signed.

### Microsoft.SqlServer.SqlManagementObjects.Loc

This package has resource DLLs with localized strings corresponding to the DLLs in Microsoft.SqlServer.SqlManagementObjects.

## Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.SmoMetadataProvider

SmoMetadataProvider provides completion support for TSQL language services in Azure Data Studio and the Sql Server extension for VS Code.


## Versioning

The major version for each SMO release corresponds with the highest Sql Server compatibility level that version of SMO supports.
For example, 140 means it supports SQL Server 2017 and below. Some features of SMO may require having a matching SQL Server version in order to work effectively, but most features are fully backward compatible.

## Dependents

SMO is a integral part of the SQL Server ecosystem. A broad set of client tools, engine components, and service components rely on it extensively. The set of SMO dependents includes:

- Azure Data Studio/Sql Tools Service
- Sql Server Management Studio
- Sql Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- Sql Powershell module
- Sql Data Sync service
- Polybase
- Azure Sql Database
- Microsoft Dynamics
- Sql Server SCOM Management Pack
