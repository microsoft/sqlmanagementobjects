# String resource file 
#
# When processed by the String Resource Tool, this file generates
# both a .CS and a .RESX file with the same name as the file.
# The .CS file contains a class which can be used to access these 
# string resources, including the ability to format in parameters,
# which are identified with the .NET {x} format (see String.Format help).    
#
# Comments below assume the file name is SR.strings.
#

#
# LocStudio comments description:
#

; For localizers and UE (These comments will be seen in LocStudio)
# For internal use (These comments will not be seen in LocStudio)

# Comments should be added before the string. 

# When the string resource file is complied the tool will read these comments 
# and push the comment using the <comment> tag into the resx file.  
# LocStudio parser looks in the resx file for the comment tag to load comments 
# into the instruction field of the database. 
# 
# For LocStudio to parse the comments the resx name must match the .resources 
# name in the manifest, so if you rename the namespace you need to change the 
# name of the project as well.  After you have done this you will need to make a 
# single character change to the string file and save, so that the SR.String cs 
# file has the correct namespace embedded in it.
